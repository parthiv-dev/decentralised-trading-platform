# Decentralised Trading Platform

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

In this project, we developed a decentralised application (dApp) for trading Pokémon cards.  The project integrates blockchain technology with NFT concepts, requiring implementation of smart contracts, frontend development, and Web3 technologies integration. We deliver a complete, functional trading platform deployed on a local testnet. 

In this README.md we explain what our project does, how to use it and what the purpose of individual files are(the essential part of every README). 

We highly encourage the reader to also read our [wiki](WIKI.md) where we delve deeper into our design choices and overall work process. We aim to allow the reader hopefully better understand design choices.
