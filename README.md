# Decentralised Trading Platform
In this project, we develop a decentralised application (dApp) for trading Pok√©mon cards.  The project integrates blockchain technology with NFT concepts, requiring implementation of smart contracts, frontend development, and Web3 technologies integration. We deliver a complete, functional trading platform deployed on a local testnet.
