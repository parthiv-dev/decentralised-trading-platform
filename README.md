# Decentralised Trading Platform

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

In this project, we developed a decentralised application (dApp) for trading Pok√©mon cards.  The project integrates blockchain technology with NFT concepts, requiring implementation of smart contracts, frontend development, and Web3 technologies integration. We deliver a complete, functional trading platform deployed on a local testnet. 

In this [README](README.md) we explain what our project does, how to use it and what the purpose of individual files are(the essential part of every README). 

We highly encourage the reader to also read our [WIKI](WIKI.md) where we delve deeper into our design choices and overall work process. We aim to allow the reader hopefully better understand design choices.

## Smart Contracts

We implment two Solidity contracts:
- [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol)
-  [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol)

[PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) follows the ERC721 standard of OpenZeppelin


[TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol) incoporates [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) in the sense that one first deploys [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol), receives its contract address and then calls (the constructor of) [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol), giving the contract address of [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) as an input. Furthermore, [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol) calls several functions of [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) in its own functions.

### IPFS integration for metadata storage

To be able to view images of pokemons on the web-based trading trading platform we decided to integrate IPFS metadata storage. 

First, we searched for a complete data set of open-source Pokemon pictures. We found a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set) with 898 images of all the Pokemons taken from the Pokedex database. Each image is of the format "name.png". We decide that we want to work with the first 100 (alphabetic) Pokemons for simplicty. 

For additional metadata for each Pokemon we referred to the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). We wrote a [Python script](data\pokemon_get_data.py) which gets the metadata based on the filenames of the kaggle image data set and stores the data for each Pokemon in JSON files of [OpenSea format](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards). The files are purposefully name as "1.json", "2.json" etc. for simplicity later on when we call the files based on the tokenId of the respective pokemon mint.

We also rename the original image files from the [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set) to "1.png", "2.png" etc. for same reason as before using a [Python script](data\pokemon_images\number_img.py). We then uploaded the [folder](data\pokemon_images\byNumber) consisting of the 100 numbered images to the [Pinata Cloud](https://pinata.cloud/) for easy access when minting on the blockchain.

[Pinata Cloud](https://pinata.cloud/) is a
