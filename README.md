## Introduction

TODO for 1. Overview:
- blockchain technology
-NFT concepts
- Implementation of smart contracts
- Frontend development
- Web3 technologies integration
- Completed function trading platform deployed on local testnet

In this project, we developed a decentralised application (dApp) for trading PokÃ©mon cards. The project integrates **blockchain technology** with **NFT concepts**, requiring implementation of [smart contracts](#smart-contracts), [frontend development](#frontend-development), and Web3 technologies integration. We deliver a complete, functional trading platform deployed on a local testnet. 

In this [README](README.md) we explain what our project does, how to use it and what the purpose of individual files are (the essential part of every README). 

We highly encourage the reader to also read our [WIKI](WIKI.md) where we delve deeper into our design choices and overall work process. We aim to allow the reader hopefully better understand design choices.

## Architecture Overview + Technical Documentation

### Smart Contracts

TODO for 3.1. Smart Contracts:
- NFT contract for Pokemon cards following ERC271 contract
- Comprehensive metadata for Pokemon characteristics
- Secure minting functionalities
- Access control

- Card listing
- Fixed-price sales
- Auctions
- Secure withdrawal patterns
- Understanding of smart contract optimization
- Security best practices in implementation
- Simplicity

We implment two Solidity contracts:
- [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol): To **securly mint** Pokemon NFTs and store comprehensive **metadata** for pokemon characteristics
-  [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol):

#### PokemonCard Contract

[PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) is based on the [OpenZeppelin ERC271 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) contract for non-fungible tokens. In addition we used following extensions:


- [ERC721Burnable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721Burnable): To enable token holders destroy their tokens.
- [ERC721Enumerable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721Enumerable): To be able to call the totalSupply() function
- [ERC721Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721Pausable): To allow privileged accounts will be able to pause the functionality marked as whenNotPaused. This is useful for emergency response.
- [ERC721URIStorage](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721URIStorage): To allow updating token URIs for individual token IDs.
- Ownable: To enable the contract owner of [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol) to mint pokemon token i.e. authorize a single account for all privileged actions.

**Access control** is ensured by: 
- the in-built Ownable (modifier)
- an auxilary mapping which maps user addresses to bool (true = allowed to mint; false = not allowed to mint)
- a modifier onlyAuthorized which check if either of the above is true for a given user

#### TradingPlatform Contract

[TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol) incoporates [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) in the sense that one first deploys [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol), receives its contract address and then calls (the constructor of) [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol), giving the contract address of [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) as an input. Furthermore, [TradingPlatform.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol) calls several functions of [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) in its own functions. 


### Frontend Development

TODO for 3.2 Front Development:
- Intuitive user interface
- Wallet connection functionality
- Comprehensive card marketplace and trading interface
- Proper Web3 integration through event listeners for contract updates, transation  handling and wallet integration

TODO for 4.1 Development Environment:
- development environment setup should be clearly documented to ensure reproducibility


### Security Considerations

- Protection against Reentrancy attacks
- Access control using function modifiers and role-base access where necessary
- IF front-running is concern (IS IT?) => afront-running prevention e.g. through the implementation of commit-reveal schemes or similar mechanisms for sensitive
operations

- 

### Advanced Enhancements

#### IPFS integration for metadata storage

To be able to view images of pokemons on the web-based trading trading platform we decided to integrate IPFS metadata storage. 

First, we searched for a complete data set of open-source Pokemon pictures. We found a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set) with 898 images of all the Pokemons taken from the Pokedex database. Each image is of the format "name.png". We decide that we want to work with the first 100 (alphabetic) Pokemons for simplicty. 

For additional metadata for each Pokemon we referred to the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). We wrote a [Python script](data\pokemon_get_data.py) which gets the metadata based on the filenames of the kaggle image data set and stores the data for each Pokemon in JSON files of [OpenSea format](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards). The files are purposefully name as "1.json", "2.json" etc. for simplicity later on when we call the files based on the tokenId of the respective pokemon mint.

We also rename the original image files from the [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set) to "1.png", "2.png" etc. for same reason as before using a [Python script](data\pokemon_images\number_img.py). We then uploaded the [folder](data\pokemon_images\byNumber) consisting of the 100 numbered images to the [Pinata Cloud](https://pinata.cloud/) for easy access when minting on the blockchain.

[Pinata Cloud](https://pinata.cloud/) is a

## Use of GenAI
TODO for 8. Use of GenAI:
- indicate which AI tools you have used

We used Github Co-Pilot, Gemini and ChatGPT for various tasks:
- Understanding of tasks and technical terms in the coursework description
- Simple code completion (especially for comments)
- Understanding of code e.g. ERC721 contract of Open Zeppelin thoroughly
- Finding mistakes in our hand-written code
- Extensively used for Python scripts, test suites, deployment scripts and other work which involves more extensive typing than actual work

We did not use or barely used GenAI for:
- Implementing the actual contracts e.g. PokemonCard.sol
- Writing this extensive [README](README.md)
- Finding the key learning and implementation objectives to be completed in the coursework

## Code Quality

TODO for 4.2 Code Quality Standards:
- minimization of code redundancy
- proper implementation
of design patterns
- code readability and organization
- quality of comments and documentation
- test coverage
- follow [Official Solidity style guide](https://soliditylang.org/)
- Proper error handling throughout codebase

We used the [Official Solidity style guide](https://soliditylang.org/) to the best of our abilities to have clean, readable code for the reader. We also inspired ourselves from OpenZeppelin's way of commenting e.g. [here]() (TODO).





## Conclusion

TODO for 2. Learning Objectives:
- Web3-integrated frontend applications
- Security best practices in DeFi development
- Understanding NFT standards + token economics
