# Decentralised Trading Platform


## Learning + Work Process

This was our first time having to develop smart contracts and build a frontend web application on top of it. We spent substantial amount of time reading into Solidity contracts, the open Zeppelin library and how to use hardhat for testing our contracts. 

### Solidity + Remix IDE

We strongly believe in learn by doing and thus searched for online resources where one not only gets an introduction to the respective topic as input but is also able to practice the gained knowledge. We came across a brilliant Solidity tutorial in our opinion on Youtube: [Solidity Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course in 4 Hours (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYpftDFiIgk&t=14004s). 

In addition to the Youtube video, the author Naz Dumansky also shares numerous exercises and accompying solutions on his [Github](https://github.com/NazaWEb/ultimate-solidity-course-for-complete-beginners) which viewers can practice with while following the tutorial. These are primarly solved in the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). We believe Remix was an excellent platform to deploy and manually test our first Solidity contracts, as it provides an intuitive testing interface with buttons and clear input fields and terminal output for testing. That is why we not only used it while solving the exerices of the Solidity tutorial but also for the initial part when developing [PokemonCard.sol](contracts\PokemonCard.sol) and [TradingPlatofrm.sol](contracts\TradingPlatform.sol).

### Hardhat?

After a while we realised that to be able to test more rigorously we must write test scripts instead of using the intuitive interface of the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). We also had to keep in mind that we would be hosting the webpage locally and be interacting heavily with the terminal. Ultimately, this made us switch from the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) to VS Code. 




## Conclusion

We believe that this way of project-based learning was very beneficial for the two of us as many courses in the bachelor's lack the practical part where one is encouraged to implement theoretically gained knowledge.
